 *
 * P\d+         Set maximum packet size
 * N            Create new packet, append to input queue, and set as current
 * S\d+-\d+f?   The first number is stream ID; these values must be in
 *                range [0, 3].  The second number is the maximum number of
 *                bytes to read from stream, potentially filling the current
 *                packet.  If `f' is set, set FIN flag.
 * C\d+-\d+     Like 'S' above, but CRYPTO frame.  Note that there is no 'f'
 *                flag as CRYPTO frames have no FINs.
 * c\d+-\d+     RST_STREAM frame.  It's different from frames [abd-z] in that
 *                n_unacked is changed.
 * V            Verify contents of packets, both STREAM and non-STREAM frames.
 * R            Resize packets
 * L\d          Label, valid values in range [0, 9]
 * J\d[=<>]\d+  Jump to label if packet size is valid [1200, 65527]
 * I\d+         Increase packet size
 * D\d+         Decrease packet size
 * [abd-z]\d+   Frame of type [a-z] of some bytes.  See letter_2_frame_type()
 *                to see how the mapping works.
 * F\d+         Standalone FIN frame.

"\n" \
"Now, this is a subject on which I flatter myself I really am _au fait_.\n" \
"The gentleman who, when I was young, bathed me at wisdom's font for nine\n" \
"guineas a term--no extras--used to say he never knew a boy who could\n" \
"do less work in more time; and I remember my poor grandmother once\n" \
"incidentally observing, in the course of an instruction upon the use\n" \
"of the Prayer-book, that it was highly improbable that I should ever do\n" \
"much that I ought not to do, but that she felt convinced beyond a doubt\n" \
"that I should leave undone pretty well everything that I ought to do.\n" \
"\n" \
"I am afraid I have somewhat belied half the dear old lady's prophecy.\n" \
"Heaven help me! I have done a good many things that I ought not to have\n" \
"done, in spite of my laziness. But I have fully confirmed the accuracy\n" \
"of her judgment so far as neglecting much that I ought not to have\n" \
"neglected is concerned. Idling always has been my strong point. I take\n" \
"no credit to myself in the matter--it is a gift. Few possess it. There\n" \
"are plenty of lazy people and plenty of slow-coaches, but a genuine\n" \
"idler is a rarity. He is not a man who slouches about with his hands in\n" \
"his pockets. On the contrary, his most startling characteristic is that\n" \
"he is always intensely busy.\n" \
"\n" \
"It is impossible to enjoy idling thoroughly unless one has plenty of\n" \
"work to do. There is no fun in doing nothing when you have nothing to\n" \
"do. Wasting time is merely an occupation then, and a most exhausting\n" \
"one. Idleness, like kisses, to be sweet must be stolen.\n" \
"\n" \
"Many years ago, when I was a young man, I was taken very ill--I never\n" \
"could see myself that much was the matter with me, except that I had\n" \
"a beastly cold. But I suppose it was something very serious, for the\n" \
"doctor said that I ought to have come to him a month before, and that\n" \
"if it (whatever it was) had gone on for another week he would not have\n" \
"answered for the consequences. It is an extraordinary thing, but I\n" \
"never knew a doctor called into any case yet but what it transpired\n" \
"that another day's delay would have rendered cure hopeless. Our medical\n" \
"guide, philosopher, and friend is like the hero in a melodrama--he\n" \
"always comes upon the scene just, and only just, in the nick of time. It\n" \
"is Providence, that is what it is.\n" \
"\n" \
"Well, as I was saying, I was very ill and was ordered to Buxton for a\n" \
"month, with strict injunctions to do nothing whatever all the while\n" \
"that I was there. \"Rest is what you require,\" said the doctor, \"perfect\n" \
"rest.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"It seemed a delightful prospect. \"This man evidently understands my\n" \
"complaint,\" said I, and I pictured to myself a glorious time--a four\n" \
"weeks' _dolce far niente_ with a dash of illness in it. Not too much\n" \
"illness, but just illness enough--just sufficient to give it the flavor\n" \
"of suffering and make it poetical. I should get up late, sip chocolate,\n" \
"and have my breakfast in slippers and a dressing-gown. I should lie out\n" \
"in the garden in a hammock and read sentimental novels with a melancholy\n" \
"ending, until the books should fall from my listless hand, and I should\n" \
"recline there, dreamily gazing into the deep blue of the firmament,\n" \
"watching the fleecy clouds floating like white-sailed ships across\n" \
"its depths, and listening to the joyous song of the birds and the low\n" \
"rustling of the trees. Or, on becoming too weak to go out of doors,\n" \
"I should sit propped up with pillows at the open window of the\n" \
"ground-floor front, and look wasted and interesting, so that all the\n" \
"pretty girls would sigh as they passed by.\n" \
"\n" \
"And twice a day I should go down in a Bath chair to the Colonnade to\n" \
"drink the waters. Oh, those waters! I knew nothing about them then,\n" \
"and was rather taken with the idea. \"Drinking the waters\" sounded\n" \
"fashionable and Queen Anne-fied, and I thought I should like them. But,\n" \
"ugh! after the first three or four mornings! Sam Weller's description of\n" \
"them as \"having a taste of warm flat-irons\" conveys only a faint idea of\n" \
"their hideous nauseousness. If anything could make a sick man get well\n" \
"quickly, it would be the knowledge that he must drink a glassful of them\n" \
"every day until he was recovered. I drank them neat for six consecutive\n" \
"days, and they nearly killed me; but after then I adopted the plan of\n" \
"taking a stiff glass of brandy-and-water immediately on the top of them,\n" \
"and found much relief thereby. I have been informed since, by various\n" \
"eminent medical gentlemen, that the alcohol must have entirely\n" \
"counteracted the effects of the chalybeate properties contained in the\n" \
"water. I am glad I was lucky enough to hit upon the right thing.\n" \
"\n" \
"But \"drinking the waters\" was only a small portion of the torture I\n" \
"experienced during that memorable month--a month which was, without\n" \
"exception, the most miserable I have ever spent. During the best part of\n" \
"it I religiously followed the doctor's mandate and did nothing whatever,\n" \
"except moon about the house and garden and go out for two hours a day in\n" \
"a Bath chair. That did break the monotony to a certain extent. There is\n" \
"more excitement about Bath-chairing--especially if you are not used to\n" \
"the exhilarating exercise--than might appear to the casual observer. A\n" \
"sense of danger, such as a mere outsider might not understand, is ever\n" \
"present to the mind of the occupant. He feels convinced every minute\n" \
"that the whole concern is going over, a conviction which becomes\n" \
"especially lively whenever a ditch or a stretch of newly macadamized\n" \
"road comes in sight. Every vehicle that passes he expects is going to\n" \
"run into him; and he never finds himself ascending or descending a\n" \
"hill without immediately beginning to speculate upon his chances,\n" \
"supposing--as seems extremely probable--that the weak-kneed controller\n" \
"of his destiny should let go.\n" \
"\n" \
"But even this diversion failed to enliven after awhile, and the _ennui_\n" \
"became perfectly unbearable. I felt my mind giving way under it. It is\n" \
"not a strong mind, and I thought it would be unwise to tax it too far.\n" \
"So somewhere about the twentieth morning I got up early, had a good\n" \
"breakfast, and walked straight off to Hayfield, at the foot of the\n" \
"Kinder Scout--a pleasant, busy little town, reached through a lovely\n" \
"valley, and with two sweetly pretty women in it. At least they were\n" \
"sweetly pretty then; one passed me on the bridge and, I think, smiled;\n" \
"and the other was standing at an open door, making an unremunerative\n" \
"investment of kisses upon a red-faced baby. But it is years ago, and I\n" \
"dare say they have both grown stout and snappish since that time.\n" \
"Coming back, I saw an old man breaking stones, and it roused such strong\n" \
"longing in me to use my arms that I offered him a drink to let me take\n" \
"his place. He was a kindly old man and he humored me. I went for those\n" \
"stones with the accumulated energy of three weeks, and did more work in\n" \
"half an hour than he had done all day. But it did not make him jealous.\n" \
"\n" \
"Having taken the plunge, I went further and further into dissipation,\n" \
"going out for a long walk every morning and listening to the band in\n" \
"the pavilion every evening. But the days still passed slowly\n" \
"notwithstanding, and I was heartily glad when the last one came and I\n" \
"was being whirled away from gouty, consumptive Buxton to London with its\n" \
"stern work and life. I looked out of the carriage as we rushed through\n" \
"Hendon in the evening. The lurid glare overhanging the mighty city\n" \
"seemed to warm my heart, and when, later on, my cab rattled out of St.\n" \
"Pancras' station, the old familiar roar that came swelling up around me\n" \
"sounded the sweetest music I had heard for many a long day.\n" \
"\n" \

"like the measles; we all have to go through it. Also like the measles,\n" \
"we take it only once. One never need be afraid of catching it a second\n" \
"time. The man who has had it can go into the most dangerous places and\n" \
"play the most foolhardy tricks with perfect safety. He can picnic in\n" \
"shady woods, ramble through leafy aisles, and linger on mossy seats to\n" \
"watch the sunset. He fears a quiet country-house no more than he would\n" \
"his own club. He can join a family party to go down the Rhine. He can,\n" \
"to see the last of a friend, venture into the very jaws of the marriage\n" \
"ceremony itself. He can keep his head through the whirl of a ravishing\n" \
"waltz, and rest afterward in a dark conservatory, catching nothing more\n" \
"lasting than a cold. He can brave a moonlight walk adown sweet-scented\n" \
"lanes or a twilight pull among the somber rushes. He can get over a\n" \
"stile without danger, scramble through a tangled hedge without being\n" \
"caught, come down a slippery path without falling. He can look into\n" \
"sunny eyes and not be dazzled. He listens to the siren voices, yet sails\n" \
"on with unveered helm. He clasps white hands in his, but no electric\n" \
"\"Lulu\"-like force holds him bound in their dainty pressure.\n" \
"\n" \
"No, we never sicken with love twice. Cupid spends no second arrow on\n" \
"the same heart. Love's handmaids are our life-long friends. Respect, and\n" \
"admiration, and affection, our doors may always be left open for, but\n" \
"their great celestial master, in his royal progress, pays but one visit\n" \
"and departs. We like, we cherish, we are very, very fond of--but we\n" \
"never love again. A man's heart is a firework that once in its time\n" \
"flashes heavenward. Meteor-like, it blazes for a moment and lights\n" \
"with its glory the whole world beneath. Then the night of our sordid\n" \
"commonplace life closes in around it, and the burned-out case, falling\n" \
"back to earth, lies useless and uncared for, slowly smoldering into\n" \
"ashes. Once, breaking loose from our prison bonds, we dare, as mighty\n" \
"old Prometheus dared, to scale the Olympian mount and snatch from\n" \
"Phoebus' chariot the fire of the gods. Happy those who, hastening down\n" \
"again ere it dies out, can kindle their earthly altars at its flame.\n" \
"Love is too pure a light to burn long among the noisome gases that we\n" \

"And, after all, that warming glow is more suited to our cold little back\n" \
"parlor of a world than is the burning spirit love. Love should be the\n" \
"vestal fire of some mighty temple--some vast dim fane whose organ music\n" \
"is the rolling of the spheres. Affection will burn cheerily when the\n" \
"white flame of love is flickered out. Affection is a fire that can be\n" \
"fed from day to day and be piled up ever higher as the wintry years draw\n" \
"nigh. Old men and women can sit by it with their thin hands clasped, the\n" \

"too much upon that unsteady flicker. It will dwindle and dwindle as the\n" \
"months roll on, and there is no replenishing the fuel. You will watch it\n" \
"die out in anger and disappointment. To each it will seem that it is the\n" \
"other who is growing colder. Edwin sees with bitterness that Angelina no\n" \
"longer runs to the gate to meet him, all smiles and blushes; and when he\n" \
"has a cough now she doesn't begin to cry and, putting her arms round his\n" \
"neck, say that she cannot live without him. The most she will probably\n" \
"do is to suggest a lozenge, and even that in a tone implying that it is\n" \
"the noise more than anything else she is anxious to get rid of.\n" \
"\n" \
"Poor little Angelina, too, sheds silent tears, for Edwin has given up\n" \
"carrying her old handkerchief in the inside pocket of his waistcoat.\n" \
"\n" \

"sees their own change. If they did they would not suffer as they do.\n" \
"They would look for the cause in the right quarter--in the littleness\n" \
"of poor human nature--join hands over their common failing, and start\n" \
"building their house anew on a more earthly and enduring foundation.\n" \
"But we are so blind to our own shortcomings, so wide awake to those\n" \
"of others. Everything that happens to us is always the other person's\n" \
"fault. Angelina would have gone on loving Edwin forever and ever and\n" \

"wildly at sixty as he does then. He cannot call to mind any middle-aged\n" \

"symptoms of frantic attachment, but that does not interfere in his\n" \
"belief in himself. His love will never fall, whoever else's may. Nobody\n" \

"experience can be no guide in his case. Alas! alas! ere thirty he has\n" \

"It is well, dear ladies, for us old sinners that you study only books.\n" \

"man's sluggish current may not be called love, compared with the rushing\n" \
"fountain that wells up when a boy's heart is struck with the heavenly\n" \
"rod. If you would taste love, drink of the pure stream that youth pours\n" \
"out at your feet. Do not wait till it has become a muddy river before\n" \
"you stoop to catch its waves.\n" \
"\n" \
"Or is it that you like its bitter flavor--that the clear, limpid water\n" \
"is insipid to your palate and that the pollution of its after-course\n" \
"gives it a relish to your lips? Must we believe those who tell us that a\n" \

"cares to be caressed by?\n" \
"\n" \
"That is the teaching that is bawled out day by day from between those\n" \

"ladyhelps, what mischief they are doing crawling about God's garden, and\n" \
"telling childish Eves and silly Adams that sin is sweet and that decency\n" \
"is ridiculous and vulgar? How many an innocent girl do they not degrade\n" \
"into an evil-minded woman? To how many a weak lad do they not point out\n" \
"the dirty by-path as the shortest cut to a maiden's heart? It is not as\n" \
"if they wrote of life as it really is. Speak truth, and right will take\n" \

"sickly fancies of their own diseased imagination.\n" \
"\n" \
"We want to think of women not--as their own sex would show them--as\n" \
"Lorleis luring us to destruction, but as good angels beckoning us\n" \
"upward. They have more power for good or evil than they dream of. It is\n" \
"just at the very age when a man's character is forming that he tumbles\n" \
"into love, and then the lass he loves has the making or marring of him.\n" \
"Unconsciously he molds himself to what she would have him, good or bad.\n" \

"you to go out at any time of the day or night without finding yourself\n" \
"eventually opposite her windows! You hadn't pluck enough to go in, but\n" \
"you hung about the corner and gazed at the outside. Oh, if the house had\n" \
"only caught fire--it was insured, so it wouldn't have mattered--and you\n" \
"could have rushed in and saved her at the risk of your life, and have\n" \
"been terribly burned and injured! Anything to serve her. Even in little\n" \

"anticipate her slightest wish! How proud you were to do her bidding! How\n" \
"delightful it was to be ordered about by her! To devote your whole life\n" \
"to her and to never think of yourself seemed such a simple thing. You\n" \
"would go without a holiday to lay a humble offering at her shrine, and\n" \
"felt more than repaid if she only deigned to accept it. How precious to\n" \
"you was everything that she had hallowed by her touch--her little glove,\n" \
"the ribbon she had worn, the rose that had nestled in her hair and whose\n" \

"\n" \

"been properly appreciated, never met with your due deserts in any one\n" \
"particular. You review the whole of your past life, and it is painfully\n" \
"apparent that you have been ill-used from your cradle.\n" \
"\n" \
"Half an hour's indulgence in these considerations works you up into\n" \
"a state of savage fury against everybody and everything, especially\n" \
"yourself, whom anatomical reasons alone prevent your kicking. Bed-time\n" \
"at last comes, to save you from doing something rash, and you spring\n" \
"upstairs, throw off your clothes, leaving them strewn all over the room,\n" \
"blow out the candle, and jump into bed as if you had backed yourself\n" \
"for a heavy wager to do the whole thing against time. There you toss\n" \
"and tumble about for a couple of hours or so, varying the monotony by\n" \
"occasionally jerking the clothes off and getting out and putting them\n" \
"on again. At length you drop into an uneasy and fitful slumber, have bad\n" \
"dreams, and wake up late the next morning.\n" \
"\n" \
"At least, this is all we poor single men can do under the circumstances.\n" \
"Married men bully their wives, grumble at the dinner, and insist on the\n" \
"children's going to bed. All of which, creating, as it does, a good deal\n" \
"of disturbance in the house, must be a great relief to the feelings of a\n" \
"man in the blues, rows being the only form of amusement in which he can\n" \
"take any interest.\n" \
"\n" \
"The symptoms of the infirmity are much the same in every case, but the\n" \
"affliction itself is variously termed. The poet says that \"a feeling\n" \
"of sadness comes o'er him.\" 'Arry refers to the heavings of his wayward\n" \
"heart by confiding to Jimee that he has \"got the blooming hump.\" Your\n" \
"sister doesn't know what is the matter with her to-night. She feels out\n" \
"of sorts altogether and hopes nothing is going to happen. The every-day\n" \
"young man is \"so awful glad to meet you, old fellow,\" for he does \"feel\n" \
"so jolly miserable this evening.\" As for myself, I generally say that \"I\n" \
"have a strange, unsettled feeling to-night\" and \"think I'll go out.\"\n" \
"\n" \
"By the way, it never does come except in the evening. In the sun-time,\n" \
"when the world is bounding forward full of life, we cannot stay to sigh\n" \
"and sulk. The roar of the working day drowns the voices of the elfin\n" \
"sprites that are ever singing their low-toned _miserere_ in our ears.\n" \
"In the day we are angry, disappointed, or indignant, but never \"in the\n" \
"blues\" and never melancholy. When things go wrong at ten o'clock in the\n" \
"morning we--or rather you--swear and knock the furniture about; but if\n" \
"the misfortune comes at ten P.M., we read poetry or sit in the dark and\n" \
"think what a hollow world this is.\n" \
"\n" \
"But, as a rule, it is not trouble that makes us melancholy. The\n" \
"actuality is too stern a thing for sentiment. We linger to weep over\n" \
"a picture, but from the original we should quickly turn our eyes away.\n" \
"There is no pathos in real misery: no luxury in real grief. We do not\n" \
"toy with sharp swords nor hug a gnawing fox to our breast for choice.\n" \
"When a man or woman loves to brood over a sorrow and takes care to keep\n" \
"it green in their memory, you may be sure it is no longer a pain to\n" \
"them. However they may have suffered from it at first, the recollection\n" \
"has become by then a pleasure. Many dear old ladies who daily look at\n" \
"tiny shoes lying in lavender-scented drawers, and weep as they think of\n" \
"the tiny feet whose toddling march is done, and sweet-faced young ones\n" \
"who place each night beneath their pillow some lock that once curled on\n" \
"a boyish head that the salt waves have kissed to death, will call me\n" \
"a nasty cynical brute and say I'm talking nonsense; but I believe,\n" \
"nevertheless, that if they will ask themselves truthfully whether they\n" \
"find it unpleasant to dwell thus on their sorrow, they will be compelled\n" \
"to answer \"No.\" Tears are as sweet as laughter to some natures. The\n" \
"proverbial Englishman, we know from old chronicler Froissart, takes his\n" \
"pleasures sadly, and the Englishwoman goes a step further and takes her\n" \
"pleasures in sadness itself.\n" \
"\n" \
"I am not sneering. I would not for a moment sneer at anything that\n" \
"helps to keep hearts tender in this hard old world. We men are cold and\n" \
"common-sensed enough for all; we would not have women the same. No, no,\n" \
"ladies dear, be always sentimental and soft-hearted, as you are--be the\n" \
"soothing butter to our coarse dry bread. Besides, sentiment is to women\n" \
"what fun is to us. They do not care for our humor, surely it would be\n" \
"unfair to deny them their grief. And who shall say that their mode of\n" \
"enjoyment is not as sensible as ours? Why assume that a doubled-up\n" \
"body, a contorted, purple face, and a gaping mouth emitting a series\n" \
"of ear-splitting shrieks point to a state of more intelligent happiness\n" \
"than a pensive face reposing upon a little white hand, and a pair of\n" \
"gentle tear-dimmed eyes looking back through Time's dark avenue upon a\n" \
"fading past?\n" \
"\n" \
"I am glad when I see Regret walked with as a friend--glad because I know\n" \
"the saltness has been washed from out the tears, and that the sting must\n" \
"have been plucked from the beautiful face of Sorrow ere we dare press\n" \
"her pale lips to ours. Time has laid his healing hand upon the wound\n" \
"when we can look back upon the pain we once fainted under and no\n" \
"bitterness or despair rises in our hearts. The burden is no longer\n" \
"heavy when we have for our past troubles only the same sweet mingling of\n" \
"pleasure and pity that we feel when old knight-hearted Colonel Newcome\n" \
"answers \"_adsum_\" to the great roll-call, or when Tom and Maggie\n" \
"Tulliver, clasping hands through the mists that have divided them, go\n" \
"down, locked in each other's arms, beneath the swollen waters of the\n" \
"Floss.\n" \
"\n" \
"Talking of poor Tom and Maggie Tulliver brings to my mind a saying of\n" \
"George Eliot's in connection with this subject of melancholy. She\n" \
"speaks somewhere of the \"sadness of a summer's evening.\" How wonderfully\n" \
"true--like everything that came from that wonderful pen--the observation\n" \
"is! Who has not felt the sorrowful enchantment of those lingering\n" \
"sunsets? The world belongs to Melancholy then, a thoughtful deep-eyed\n" \
"maiden who loves not the glare of day. It is not till \"light thickens\n" \
"and the crow wings to the rocky wood\" that she steals forth from her\n" \
"groves. Her palace is in twilight land. It is there she meets us. At her\n" \
"shadowy gate she takes our hand in hers and walks beside us through\n" \
"her mystic realm. We see no form, but seem to hear the rustling of her\n" \
"wings.\n" \
"\n" \
"Even in the toiling hum-drum city her spirit comes to us. There is a\n" \
"somber presence in each long, dull street; and the dark river creeps\n" \
"ghostlike under the black arches, as if bearing some hidden secret\n" \
"beneath its muddy waves.\n" \
"\n" \
"In the silent country, when the trees and hedges loom dim and blurred\n" \
"against the rising night, and the bat's wing flutters in our face, and\n" \
"the land-rail's cry sounds drearily across the fields, the spell sinks\n" \
"deeper still into our hearts. We seem in that hour to be standing by\n" \
"some unseen death-bed, and in the swaying of the elms we hear the sigh\n" \
"of the dying day.\n" \
"\n" \
"A solemn sadness reigns. A great peace is around us. In its light\n" \
"our cares of the working day grow small and trivial, and bread and\n" \
"cheese--ay, and even kisses--do not seem the only things worth striving\n" \
"for. Thoughts we cannot speak but only listen to flood in upon us, and\n" \
"standing in the stillness under earth's darkening dome, we feel that we\n" \
"are greater than our petty lives. Hung round with those dusky curtains,\n" \
"the world is no longer a mere dingy workshop, but a stately temple\n" \
"wherein man may worship, and where at times in the dimness his groping\n" \
"hands touch God's.\n"

"ON BEING HARD UP.\n" \
"\n" \
"It is a most remarkable thing. I sat down with the full intention of\n" \
"writing something clever and original; but for the life of me I can't\n" \
"think of anything clever and original--at least, not at this moment. The\n" \
"only thing I can think about now is being hard up. I suppose having my\n" \
"hands in my pockets has made me think about this. I always do sit with\n" \
"my hands in my pockets except when I am in the company of my sisters,\n" \
"my cousins, or my aunts; and they kick up such a shindy--I should say\n" \
"expostulate so eloquently upon the subject--that I have to give in and\n" \
"take them out--my hands I mean. The chorus to their objections is that\n" \
"it is not gentlemanly. I am hanged if I can see why. I could understand\n" \
"its not being considered gentlemanly to put your hands in other people's\n" \
"pockets (especially by the other people), but how, O ye sticklers for\n" \
"what looks this and what looks that, can putting his hands in his own\n" \
"pockets make a man less gentle? Perhaps you are right, though. Now I\n" \
"come to think of it, I have heard some people grumble most savagely when\n" \
"doing it. But they were mostly old gentlemen. We young fellows, as a\n" \
"rule, are never quite at ease unless we have our hands in our pockets.\n" \
"We are awkward and shifty. We are like what a music-hall Lion Comique\n" \
"would be without his opera-hat, if such a thing can be imagined. But let\n" \
"us put our hands in our trousers pockets, and let there be some small\n" \
"change in the right-hand one and a bunch of keys in the left, and we\n" \
"will face a female post-office clerk.\n" \
"\n" \
"It is a little difficult to know what to do with your hands, even in\n" \
"your pockets, when there is nothing else there. Years ago, when my whole\n" \
"capital would occasionally come down to \"what in town the people call\n" \
"a bob,\" I would recklessly spend a penny of it, merely for the sake of\n" \
"having the change, all in coppers, to jingle. You don't feel nearly so\n" \
"hard up with eleven pence in your pocket as you do with a shilling. Had\n" \
"I been \"La-di-da,\" that impecunious youth about whom we superior folk\n" \
"are so sarcastic, I would have changed my penny for two ha'pennies.\n" \
"\n" \
"I can speak with authority on the subject of being hard up. I have been\n" \
"a provincial actor. If further evidence be required, which I do not\n" \
"think likely, I can add that I have been a \"gentleman connected with the\n" \
"press.\" I have lived on 15 shilling a week. I have lived a week on 10,\n" \
"owing the other 5; and I have lived for a fortnight on a great-coat.\n" \
"\n" \
"It is wonderful what an insight into domestic economy being really hard\n" \
"up gives one. If you want to find out the value of money, live on\n" \
"15 shillings a week and see how much you can put by for clothes and\n" \
"recreation. You will find out that it is worth while to wait for the\n" \
"farthing change, that it is worth while to walk a mile to save a\n" \
"penny, that a glass of beer is a luxury to be indulged in only at rare\n" \
"intervals, and that a collar can be worn for four days.\n" \
"\n" \
"Try it just before you get married. It will be excellent practice. Let\n" \
"your son and heir try it before sending him to college. He won't grumble\n" \
"at a hundred a year pocket-money then. There are some people to whom it\n" \
"would do a world of good. There is that delicate blossom who can't drink\n" \
"any claret under ninety-four, and who would as soon think of dining\n" \
"off cat's meat as off plain roast mutton. You do come across these\n" \
"poor wretches now and then, though, to the credit of humanity, they are\n" \
"principally confined to that fearful and wonderful society known only\n" \
"to lady novelists. I never hear of one of these creatures discussing a\n" \
"_menu_ card but I feel a mad desire to drag him off to the bar of\n" \
"some common east-end public-house and cram a sixpenny dinner down his\n" \
"throat--beefsteak pudding, fourpence; potatoes, a penny; half a pint of\n" \
"porter, a penny. The recollection of it (and the mingled fragrance of\n" \
"beer, tobacco, and roast pork generally leaves a vivid impression) might\n" \
"induce him to turn up his nose a little less frequently in the future\n" \
"at everything that is put before him. Then there is that generous party,\n" \
"the cadger's delight, who is so free with his small change, but who\n" \
"never thinks of paying his debts. It might teach even him a little\n" \
"common sense. \"I always give the waiter a shilling. One can't give the\n" \
"fellow less, you know,\" explained a young government clerk with whom I\n" \
"was lunching the other day in Regent Street. I agreed with him as to the\n" \
"utter impossibility of making it elevenpence ha'penny; but at the same\n" \
"time I resolved to one day decoy him to an eating-house I remembered\n" \
"near Covent Garden, where the waiter, for the better discharge of his\n" \
"duties, goes about in his shirt-sleeves--and very dirty sleeves they\n" \
"are, too, when it gets near the end of the month. I know that waiter.\n" \
"If my friend gives him anything beyond a penny, the man will insist on\n" \
"shaking hands with him then and there as a mark of his esteem; of that I\n" \
"feel sure.\n" \
"\n" \
"There have been a good many funny things said and written about\n" \
"hardupishness, but the reality is not funny, for all that. It is not\n" \
"funny to have to haggle over pennies. It isn't funny to be thought\n" \
"mean and stingy. It isn't funny to be shabby and to be ashamed of your\n" \
"address. No, there is nothing at all funny in poverty--to the poor. It\n" \
"is hell upon earth to a sensitive man; and many a brave gentleman who\n" \
"would have faced the labors of Hercules has had his heart broken by its\n" \
"petty miseries.\n" \
"\n" \
"It is not the actual discomforts themselves that are hard to bear.\n" \
"Who would mind roughing it a bit if that were all it meant? What cared\n" \
"Robinson Crusoe for a patch on his trousers? Did he wear trousers? I\n" \
"forget; or did he go about as he does in the pantomimes? What did it\n" \
"matter to him if his toes did stick out of his boots? and what if\n" \
"his umbrella was a cotton one, so long as it kept the rain off? His\n" \
"shabbiness did not trouble him; there was none of his friends round\n" \
"about to sneer him.\n" \
"\n" \
"Being poor is a mere trifle. It is being known to be poor that is the\n" \
"sting. It is not cold that makes a man without a great-coat hurry along\n" \
"so quickly. It is not all shame at telling lies--which he knows will\n" \
"not be believed--that makes him turn so red when he informs you that\n" \
"he considers great-coats unhealthy and never carries an umbrella on\n" \
"principle. It is easy enough to say that poverty is no crime. No; if\n" \
"it were men wouldn't be ashamed of it. It's a blunder, though, and is\n" \
"punished as such. A poor man is despised the whole world over; despised\n" \
"as much by a Christian as by a lord, as much by a demagogue as by a\n" \
"footman, and not all the copy-book maxims ever set for ink stained youth\n" \
"will make him respected. Appearances are everything, so far as human\n" \
"opinion goes, and the man who will walk down Piccadilly arm in arm with\n" \
"the most notorious scamp in London, provided he is a well-dressed one,\n" \
"will slink up a back street to say a couple of words to a seedy-looking\n" \
"gentleman. And the seedy-looking gentleman knows this--no one\n" \
"better--and will go a mile round to avoid meeting an acquaintance. Those\n" \
"that knew him in his prosperity need never trouble themselves to look\n" \
"the other way. He is a thousand times more anxious that they should not\n" \
"see him than they can be; and as to their assistance, there is nothing\n" \
"he dreads more than the offer of it. All he wants is to be forgotten;\n" \
"and in this respect he is generally fortunate enough to get what he\n" \
"wants.\n" \
"\n" \
"One becomes used to being hard up, as one becomes used to everything\n" \
"else, by the help of that wonderful old homeopathic doctor, Time. You\n" \
"can tell at a glance the difference between the old hand and the novice;\n" \
"between the case-hardened man who has been used to shift and struggle\n" \
"for years and the poor devil of a beginner striving to hide his misery,\n" \
"and in a constant agony of fear lest he should be found out. Nothing\n" \
"shows this difference more clearly than the way in which each will pawn\n" \
"his watch. As the poet says somewhere: \"True ease in pawning comes from\n" \
"art, not chance.\" The one goes into his \"uncle's\" with as much composure\n" \
"as he would into his tailor's--very likely with more. The assistant is\n" \
"even civil and attends to him at once, to the great indignation of the\n" \
"lady in the next box, who, however, sarcastically observes that she\n" \
"don't mind being kept waiting \"if it is a regular customer.\" Why, from\n" \
"the pleasant and businesslike manner in which the transaction is carried\n" \
"out, it might be a large purchase in the three per cents. Yet what a\n" \
"piece of work a man makes of his first \"pop.\" A boy popping his first\n" \
"question is confidence itself compared with him. He hangs about outside\n" \
"the shop until he has succeeded in attracting the attention of all the\n" \
"loafers in the neighborhood and has aroused strong suspicions in the\n" \
"mind of the policeman on the beat. At last, after a careful examination\n" \
"of the contents of the windows, made for the purpose of impressing the\n" \
"bystanders with the notion that he is going in to purchase a diamond\n" \
"bracelet or some such trifle, he enters, trying to do so with a careless\n" \
"swagger, and giving himself really the air of a member of the swell mob.\n" \
"When inside he speaks in so low a voice as to be perfectly inaudible,\n" \
"and has to say it all over again. When, in the course of his rambling\n" \
"conversation about a \"friend\" of his, the word \"lend\" is reached, he is\n" \
"promptly told to go up the court on the right and take the first door\n" \
"round the corner. He comes out of the shop with a face that you could\n" \
"easily light a cigarette at, and firmly under the impression that the\n" \
"whole population of the district is watching him. When he does get\n" \
"to the right place he has forgotten his name and address and is in a\n" \
"general condition of hopeless imbecility. Asked in a severe tone how he\n" \
"came by \"this,\" he stammers and contradicts himself, and it is only a\n" \
"miracle if he does not confess to having stolen it that very day. He is\n" \
"thereupon informed that they don't want anything to do with his sort,\n" \
"and that he had better get out of this as quickly as possible, which he\n" \
"does, recollecting nothing more until he finds himself three miles off,\n" \
"without the slightest knowledge how he got there.\n" \
"\n" \
"By the way, how awkward it is, though, having to depend on public-houses\n" \
"and churches for the time. The former are generally too fast and the\n" \
"latter too slow. Besides which, your efforts to get a glimpse of\n" \
"the public house clock from the outside are attended with great\n" \
"difficulties. If you gently push the swing-door ajar and peer in you\n" \
"draw upon yourself the contemptuous looks of the barmaid, who at once\n" \
"puts you down in the same category with area sneaks and cadgers. You\n" \
"also create a certain amount of agitation among the married portion of\n" \
"the customers. You don't see the clock because it is behind the door;\n" \
"and in trying to withdraw quietly you jam your head. The only other\n" \
"method is to jump up and down outside the window. After this latter\n" \
"proceeding, however, if you do not bring out a banjo and commence to\n" \
"sing, the youthful inhabitants of the neighborhood, who have gathered\n" \
"round in expectation, become disappointed.\n" \
"\n" \
"I should like to know, too, by what mysterious law of nature it is that\n" \
"before you have left your watch \"to be repaired\" half an hour, some one\n" \
"is sure to stop you in the street and conspicuously ask you the time.\n" \
"Nobody even feels the slightest curiosity on the subject when you've got\n" \
"it on.\n" \
"\n" \
"Dear old ladies and gentlemen who know nothing about being hard up--and\n" \
"may they never, bless their gray old heads--look upon the pawn-shop\n" \
"as the last stage of degradation; but those who know it better (and my\n" \
"readers have no doubt, noticed this themselves) are often surprised,\n" \
"like the little boy who dreamed he went to heaven, at meeting so many\n" \
"people there that they never expected to see. For my part, I think it a\n" \
"much more independent course than borrowing from friends, and I always\n" \
"try to impress this upon those of my acquaintance who incline toward\n" \
"\"wanting a couple of pounds till the day after to-morrow.\" But they\n" \
"won't all see it. One of them once remarked that he objected to the\n" \
"principle of the thing. I fancy if he had said it was the interest that\n" \
"he objected to he would have been nearer the truth: twenty-five per\n" \
"cent. certainly does come heavy.\n" \
"\n" \
"There are degrees in being hard up. We are all hard up, more or\n" \
"less--most of us more. Some are hard up for a thousand pounds; some for\n" \
"a shilling. Just at this moment I am hard up myself for a fiver. I only\n" \
"want it for a day or two. I should be certain of paying it back within a\n" \
"week at the outside, and if any lady or gentleman among my readers would\n" \
"kindly lend it me, I should be very much obliged indeed. They could send\n" \
"it to me under cover to Messrs. Field & Tuer, only, in such case, please\n" \
"let the envelope be carefully sealed. I would give you my I.O.U. as\n" \
"security.\n"
