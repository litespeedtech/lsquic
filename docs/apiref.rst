API Reference
=============

.. highlight:: c

Preliminaries
-------------

All declarations are in :file:`lsquic.h`, so it is enough to

::

    #incluide <lsquic.h>

in each source file.


Library Version
---------------

LSQUIC follows the following versioning model.  The version number
has the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where

- MAJOR changes when a large redesign occurs;
- MINOR changes when an API change or another significant change occurs; and
- PATCH changes when a bug is fixed or another small, API-compatible change occurs.

QUIC Versions
-------------

LSQUIC supports two types of QUIC protocol: Google QUIC and IETF QUIC.  The
former will at some point become obsolete, while the latter is still being
developed by the IETF.  Both types are included in a single enum:

.. type:: enum lsquic_version

    .. member:: LSQVER_043

        Google QUIC version Q043

    .. member:: LSQVER_046

        Google QUIC version Q046

    .. member:: LSQVER_050

        Google QUIC version Q050

    .. member:: LSQVER_ID25

        IETF QUIC version ID (Internet-Draft) 25

    .. member:: LSQVER_ID27

        IETF QUIC version ID 27

    .. member:: N_LSQVER

        Special value indicating the number of versions in the enum.  It
        may be used as argument to :func:`lsquic_engine_connect()`.

Several version lists (as bitmasks) are defined in :file:`lsquic.h`:

.. macro:: LSQUIC_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS

List of all supported versions.

.. macro:: LSQUIC_FORCED_TCID0_VERSIONS

List of versions in which the server never includes CID in short packets.

.. macro:: LSQUIC_EXPERIMENTAL_VERSIONS

Experimental versions.

.. macro: LSQUIC_DEPRECATED_VERSIONS

Deprecated versions.

.. macro:: LSQUIC_GQUIC_HEADER_VERSIONS

Versions that have Google QUIC-like headers.  Only Q043 remains in this
list.

.. macro:: LSQUIC_IETF_VERSIONS

IETF QUIC versions.

.. macro:: LSQUIC_IETF_DRAFT_VERSIONS

IETF QUIC *draft* versions.  When IETF QUIC v1 is released, it will not
be included in this list.

LSQUIC Types
------------

LSQUIC declares several types used by many of its public functions.  They are:

.. type:: lsquic_engine_t

    Instance of LSQUIC engine.

.. type:: lsquic_conn_t

    QUIC connection.

.. type:: lsquic_stream_t

    QUIC stream.

.. type:: lsquic_stream_id_t

    Stream ID.

.. type:: lsquic_conn_ctx_t

    Connection context.  This is the return value of :func:`on_new_conn()`.
    To LSQUIC, this is just an opaque pointer.  User code is expected to
    use it for its own purposes.

.. type:: lsquic_stream_ctx_t

    Stream context.  This is the return value of :func:`on_new_stream()`.
    To LSQUIC, this is just an opaque pointer.  User code is expected to
    use it for its own purposes.

.. type:: lsquic_http_headers_t

    HTTP headers

Library Initialization
----------------------

Before using the library, internal structures must be initialized using
the global initialization function:

::

    if (0 == lsquic_global_init(LSQUIC_GLOBAL_CLIENT|LSQUIC_GLOBAL_SERVER))
        /* OK, do something useful */
        ;

This call only needs to be made once.  Afterwards, any number of LSQUIC
engines may be instantiated.

After a process is done using LSQUIC, it should clean up:

::

    lsquic_global_cleanup();

Logging
-------

.. type:: struct lsquic_logger_if

    .. member:: int     (*log_buf)(void *logger_ctx, const char *buf, size_t len)

.. function:: void lsquic_logger_init (const struct lsquic_logger_if *logger_if, void *logger_ctx, enum lsquic_logger_timestamp_style)

    Call this if you want to do something with LSQUIC log messages, as they are thrown out by default.

.. function:: int lsquic_set_log_level (const char *log_level)

    Set log level for all LSQUIC modules.

    :param log_level: Acceptable values are debug, info, notice, warning, error, alert, emerg, crit (case-insensitive).
    :return: 0 on success or -1 on failure (invalid log level).

.. function:: int lsquic_logger_lopt (const char *log_specs)

    Set log level for a particular module or several modules.

    :param log_specs:

        One or more "module=level" specifications serapated by comma.
        For example, "event=debug,engine=info".  See `List of Log Modules`_

Engine Instantiation and Destruction
------------------------------------

To use the library, an instance of the ``struct lsquic_engine`` needs to be
created:

.. function:: lsquic_engine_t *lsquic_engine_new (unsigned flags, const struct lsquic_engine_api *api)

    Create a new engine.

    :param flags: This is is a bitmask of ``LSENG_SERVER``` and ``LSENG_HTTP``.
    :param api: Pointer to an initialized :type:`lsquic_engine_api`.

    The engine can be instantiated either in server mode (when ``LSENG_SERVER``
    is set) or client mode.  If you need both server and client in your program,
    create two engines (or as many as you'd like).

    Specifying ``LSENG_HTTP`` flag enables the HTTP functionality: HTTP/2-like
    for Google QUIC connections and HTTP/3 functionality for IETF QUIC
    connections.

.. function:: void lsquic_engine_cooldown (lsquic_engine_t *engine)

    This function closes all mini connections and marks all full connections
    as going away.  In server mode, this also causes the engine to stop
    creating new connections.

.. function:: void lsquic_engine_destroy (lsquic_engine_t *engine)

    Destroy engine and all its resources.

Engine Callbacks
----------------

``struct lsquic_engine_api`` contains a few mandatory members and several
optional members.

.. type:: struct lsquic_engine_api

    .. member:: const struct lsquic_stream_if       *ea_stream_if
    .. member:: void                                *ea_stream_if_ctx

        ``ea_stream_if`` is mandatory.  This structure contains pointers
        to callbacks that handle connections and stream events.

    .. member:: lsquic_packets_out_f                 ea_packets_out
    .. member:: void                                *ea_packets_out_ctx

        ``ea_packets_out`` is used by the engine to send packets.

    .. member:: const struct lsquic_engine_settings *ea_settings

        If ``ea_settings`` is set to NULL, the engine uses default settings
        (see :func:`lsquic_engine_init_settings()`)

    .. member:: lsquic_lookup_cert_f                 ea_lookup_cert
    .. member:: void                                *ea_cert_lu_ctx

        Look up certificate.  Mandatory in server mode.

    .. member:: struct ssl_ctx_st *                (*ea_get_ssl_ctx)(void *peer_ctx)

        Get SSL_CTX associated with a peer context.  Mandatory in server
        mode.  This is use for default values for SSL instantiation.

    .. member:: const struct lsquic_hset_if         *ea_hsi_if
    .. member:: void                                *ea_hsi_ctx

        Optional header set interface.  If not specified, the incoming headers
        are converted to HTTP/1.x format and are read from stream and have to
        be parsed again.

    .. member:: const struct lsquic_shared_hash_if  *ea_shi
    .. member:: void                                *ea_shi_ctx

        Shared hash interface can be used to share state between several
        processes of a single QUIC server.

    .. member:: const struct lsquic_packout_mem_if  *ea_pmi
    .. member:: void                                *ea_pmi_ctx

        Optional set of functions to manage memory allocation for outgoing
        packets.

    .. member:: lsquic_cids_update_f                 ea_new_scids
    .. member:: lsquic_cids_update_f                 ea_live_scids
    .. member:: lsquic_cids_update_f                 ea_old_scids
    .. member:: void                                *ea_cids_update_ctx

        In a multi-process setup, it may be useful to observe the CID
        lifecycle.  This optional set of callbacks makes it possible.

.. _apiref-engine-settings:

Engine Settings
---------------

Engine behavior can be controlled by several settings specified in the
settings structure:

.. type:: struct lsquic_engine_settings

    .. member:: unsigned        es_versions

        This is a bit mask wherein each bit corresponds to a value in
        :type:`lsquic_version`.  Client starts negotiating with the highest
        version and goes down.  Server supports either of the versions
        specified here.  This setting applies to both Google and IETF QUIC.

        The default value is :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_VERSIONS`.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_cfcw

       Initial default connection flow control window.

       In server mode, per-connection values may be set lower than
       this if resources are scarce.

       Do not set es_cfcw and es_sfcw lower than :macro:`LSQUIC_MIN_FCW`.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_sfcw

       Initial default stream flow control window.

       In server mode, per-connection values may be set lower than
       this if resources are scarce.

       Do not set es_cfcw and es_sfcw lower than :macro:`LSQUIC_MIN_FCW`.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_max_cfcw

       This value is used to specify maximum allowed value connection flow
       control window is allowed to reach due to window auto-tuning.  By
       default, this value is zero, which means that CFCW is not allowed
       to increase from its initial value.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_max_sfcw

       This value is used to specify maximum allowed value stream flow
       control window is allowed to reach due to window auto-tuning.  By
       default, this value is zero, which means that CFCW is not allowed
       to increase from its initial value.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_max_streams_in

        Maximum incoming streams, a.k.a. MIDS.

        Google QUIC only.

    .. member:: unsigned long   es_handshake_to

       Handshake timeout in microseconds.

       For client, this can be set to an arbitrary value (zero turns the
       timeout off).

       For server, this value is limited to about 16 seconds.  Do not set
       it to zero.

       Defaults to :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_HANDSHAKE_TO`.

    .. member:: unsigned long   es_idle_conn_to

        Idle connection timeout, a.k.a ICSL, in microseconds; GQUIC only.

        Defaults to :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_IDLE_CONN_TO`

    .. member:: int             es_silent_close

        SCLS (silent close)

    .. member:: unsigned        es_max_header_list_size

       This corresponds to SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE
       (:rfc:`7540#section-6.5.2`).  0 means no limit.  Defaults
       to :func:`LSQUIC_DF_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE`.

    .. member:: const char     *es_ua

        UAID -- User-Agent ID.  Defaults to :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_UA`.

        Google QUIC only.


       More parameters for server

    .. member:: unsigned        es_max_inchoate

        Maximum number of incoming connections in inchoate state.  (In
        other words, maximum number of mini connections.)

        This is only applicable in server mode.

        Defaults to :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_MAX_INCHOATE`.

    .. member:: int             es_support_push

       Setting this value to 0 means that

       For client:

       1. we send a SETTINGS frame to indicate that we do not support server
          push; and
       2. all incoming pushed streams get reset immediately.

       (For maximum effect, set es_max_streams_in to 0.)

       For server:

       1. :func:`lsquic_conn_push_stream()` will return -1.

    .. member:: int             es_support_tcid0

       If set to true value, the server will not include connection ID in
       outgoing packets if client's CHLO specifies TCID=0.

       For client, this means including TCID=0 into CHLO message.  Note that
       in this case, the engine tracks connections by the
       (source-addr, dest-addr) tuple, thereby making it necessary to create
       a socket for each connection.

       This option has no effect in Q046, as the server never includes
       CIDs in the short packets.

       The default is :func:`LSQUIC_DF_SUPPORT_TCID0`.

    .. member:: int             es_support_nstp

       Q037 and higher support "No STOP_WAITING frame" mode.  When set, the
       client will send NSTP option in its Client Hello message and will not
       sent STOP_WAITING frames, while ignoring incoming STOP_WAITING frames,
       if any.  Note that if the version negotiation happens to downgrade the
       client below Q037, this mode will *not* be used.

       This option does not affect the server, as it must support NSTP mode
       if it was specified by the client.

        Defaults to :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_SUPPORT_NSTP`.

    .. member:: int             es_honor_prst

       If set to true value, the library will drop connections when it
       receives corresponding Public Reset packet.  The default is to
       ignore these packets.

    .. member:: int             es_send_prst

       If set to true value, the library will send Public Reset packets
       in response to incoming packets with unknown Connection IDs.

       The default is :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_SEND_PRST`.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_progress_check

       A non-zero value enables internal checks that identify suspected
       infinite loops in user `on_read` and `on_write` callbacks
       and break them.  An infinite loop may occur if user code keeps
       on performing the same operation without checking status, e.g.
       reading from a closed stream etc.

       The value of this parameter is as follows: should a callback return
       this number of times in a row without making progress (that is,
       reading, writing, or changing stream state), loop break will occur.

       The defaut value is :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_PROGRESS_CHECK`.

    .. member:: int             es_rw_once

       A non-zero value make stream dispatch its read-write events once
       per call.

       When zero, read and write events are dispatched until the stream
       is no longer readable or writeable, respectively, or until the
       user signals unwillingness to read or write using
       :func:`lsquic_stream_wantread()` or :func:`lsquic_stream_wantwrite()`
       or shuts down the stream.

       The default value is :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_RW_ONCE`.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_proc_time_thresh

       If set, this value specifies that number of microseconds that
       :func:`lsquic_engine_process_conns()` and
       :func:`lsquic_engine_send_unsent_packets()` are allowed to spend
       before returning.

       This is not an exact science and the connections must make
       progress, so the deadline is checked after all connections get
       a chance to tick (in the case of :func:`lsquic_engine_process_conns())`
       and at least one batch of packets is sent out.

       When processing function runs out of its time slice, immediate
       calls to :func:`lsquic_engine_has_unsent_packets()` return false.

       The default value is :func:`LSQUIC_DF_PROC_TIME_THRESH`.

    .. member:: int             es_pace_packets

       If set to true, packet pacing is implemented per connection.

       The default value is :func:`LSQUIC_DF_PACE_PACKETS`.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_clock_granularity

       Clock granularity information is used by the pacer.  The value
       is in microseconds; default is :func:`LSQUIC_DF_CLOCK_GRANULARITY`.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_init_max_data

       Initial max data.

       This is a transport parameter.

       Depending on the engine mode, the default value is either
       :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_INIT_MAX_DATA_CLIENT` or
       :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_INIT_MAX_DATA_SERVER`.

       IETF QUIC only.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_init_max_stream_data_bidi_remote

       Initial max stream data.

       This is a transport parameter.

       Depending on the engine mode, the default value is either
       :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_INIT_MAX_STREAM_DATA_BIDI_REMOTE_CLIENT` or
       :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_INIT_MAX_STREAM_DATA_BIDI_REMOTE_SERVER`.

       IETF QUIC only.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_init_max_stream_data_bidi_local

       Initial max stream data.

       This is a transport parameter.

       Depending on the engine mode, the default value is either
       :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_INIT_MAX_STREAM_DATA_BIDI_LOCAL_CLIENT` or
       :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_INIT_MAX_STREAM_DATA_BIDI_LOCAL_SERVER`.

       IETF QUIC only.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_init_max_stream_data_uni

       Initial max stream data for unidirectional streams initiated
       by remote endpoint.

       This is a transport parameter.

       Depending on the engine mode, the default value is either
       :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_INIT_MAX_STREAM_DATA_UNI_CLIENT` or
       :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_INIT_MAX_STREAM_DATA_UNI_SERVER`.

       IETF QUIC only.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_init_max_streams_bidi

       Maximum initial number of bidirectional stream.

       This is a transport parameter.

       Default value is :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_INIT_MAX_STREAMS_BIDI`.

       IETF QUIC only.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_init_max_streams_uni

       Maximum initial number of unidirectional stream.

       This is a transport parameter.

       :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_INIT_MAX_STREAM_DATA_UNI_SERVER`.

       IETF QUIC only.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_idle_timeout

       Idle connection timeout.

       This is a transport parameter.

       (Note: `es_idle_conn_to` is not reused because it is in microseconds,
       which, I now realize, was not a good choice.  Since it will be
       obsoleted some time after the switchover to IETF QUIC, we do not
       have to keep on using strange units.)

       Default value is :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_IDLE_TIMEOUT`.

       Maximum value is 600 seconds.

       IETF QUIC only.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_ping_period

       Ping period.  If set to non-zero value, the connection will generate and
       send PING frames in the absence of other activity.

       By default, the server does not send PINGs and the period is set to zero.
       The client's defaut value is :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_PING_PERIOD`.

       IETF QUIC only.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_scid_len

       Source Connection ID length.  Valid values are 0 through 20, inclusive.

       IETF QUIC only.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_scid_iss_rate

       Source Connection ID issuance rate.  This field is measured in CIDs
       per minute.  Using value 0 indicates that there is no rate limit for
       CID issuance.

       Default value is :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_SCID_ISS_RATE`.

       IETF QUIC only.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_qpack_dec_max_size

       Maximum size of the QPACK dynamic table that the QPACK decoder will
       use.

       The default is :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_QPACK_DEC_MAX_SIZE`.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_qpack_dec_max_blocked

       Maximum number of blocked streams that the QPACK decoder is willing
       to tolerate.

       IETF QUIC only.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_qpack_enc_max_size

       Maximum size of the dynamic table that the encoder is willing to use.
       The actual size of the dynamic table will not exceed the minimum of
       this value and the value advertized by peer.

       The default is :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_QPACK_ENC_MAX_SIZE`.

       IETF QUIC only.

    .. member:: unsigned        es_qpack_enc_max_blocked

       Maximum number of blocked streams that the QPACK encoder is willing
       to risk.  The actual number of blocked streams will not exceed the
       minimum of this value and the value advertized by peer.

       The default is :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_QPACK_ENC_MAX_BLOCKED`.

       IETF QUIC only.

    .. member:: int             es_ecn

    .. member:: int             es_delayed_acks

       Enable delayed ACKs extension.  Allowed values are 0 and 1.

       **Warning**: this is an experimental feature.  Using it will most likely
       lead to degraded performance.

       peer in transport parameters: the library does not enforce this
       limit for incoming packets.

       If set to zero, limit is not set.

       Default value is :macro:`LSQUIC_DF_MAX_UDP_PAYLOAD_SIZE_RX`

To initialize the settings structure to library defaults, use the following
convenience function:

.. function:: lsquic_engine_init_settings (struct lsquic_engine_settings *, unsigned flags)

    ``flags`` is a bitmask of ``LSENG_SERVER`` and ``LSENG_HTTP``

After doing this, change just the settings you'd like.  To check whether
the values are correct, another convenience function is provided:

.. function:: lsquic_engine_check_settings (const struct lsquic_engine_settings *, unsigned flags, char *err_buf, size_t err_buf_sz)

    Check settings for errors.  Return 0 if settings are OK, -1 otherwise.

    If `err_buf` and `err_buf_sz` are set, an error string is written to the
    buffers.

The following macros in :file:`lsquic.h` specify default values:

*Note that, despite our best efforts, documentation may accidentally get
out of date.  Please check your :file:`lsquic.h` for actual values.*

.. macro::      LSQUIC_MIN_FCW

Receiving Packets
-----------------

Incoming packets are supplied to the engine using :func:`lsquic_engine_packet_in()`.
It is up to the engine to decide what do to with the packet.  It can find an existing
connection and dispatch the packet there, create a new connection (in server mode), or
schedule a version negotiation or stateless reset packet.

.. function:: int lsquic_engine_packet_in (lsquic_engine_t *engine, const unsigned char *data, size_t size, const struct sockaddr *local, const struct sockaddr *peer, void *peer_ctx, int ecn)

    Pass incoming packet to the QUIC engine.  This function can be called
    more than once in a row.  After you add one or more packets, call
    :func:`lsquic_engine_process_conns()` to schedule outgoing packets, if any.

    :param engine: Engine instance.
    :param data: Pointer to UDP datagram payload.
    :param size: Size of UDP datagram.
    :param local: Local address.
    :param peer: Peer address.
    :param peer_ctx: Peer context.
    :param ecn: ECN marking associated with this UDP datagram.

    :return:

        - ``0``: Packet was processed by a real connection.
        - ``1``: Packet was handled successfully, but not by a connection.
          This may happen with version negotiation and public reset
          packets as well as some packets that may be ignored.
        - ``-1``: Some error occurred.  Possible reasons are invalid packet
          size or failure to allocate memory.

.. function:: int lsquic_engine_earliest_adv_tick (lsquic_engine_t *engine, int *diff)

    Returns true if there are connections to be processed, false otherwise.

    :param engine:

        Engine instance.

    :param diff:

        If the function returns a true value, the pointed to integer is set to the
        difference between the earliest advisory tick time and now.
        If the former is in the past, this difference is negative.

    :return:

        True if there are connections to be processed, false otherwise.

Sending Packets
---------------

User specifies a callback :type:`lsquic_packets_out_f` in :type:`lsquic_engine_api`
that the library uses to send packets.

.. type:: struct lsquic_out_spec

    This structure describes an outgoing packet.

    .. member:: struct iovec          *iov

        A vector with payload.

    .. member:: size_t                 iovlen

        Vector length.

    .. member:: const struct sockaddr *local_sa

        Local address.

    .. member:: const struct sockaddr *dest_sa

        Destination address.

    .. member:: void                  *peer_ctx

        Peer context associated with the local address.

    .. member:: int                    ecn

        ECN: Valid values are 0 - 3. See :rfc:`3168`.

        ECN may be set by IETF QUIC connections if ``es_ecn`` is set.

.. type: typedef int (*lsquic_packets_out_f)(void *packets_out_ctx, const struct lsquic_out_spec  *out_spec, unsigned n_packets_out)

    Returns number of packets successfully sent out or -1 on error.  -1 should
    only be returned if no packets were sent out.  If -1 is returned or if the
    return value is smaller than ``n_packets_out``, this indicates that sending
    of packets is not possible.

    If not all packets could be sent out, then:

        - errno is examined.  If it is not EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK, the connection
          whose packet caused the error is closed forthwith.
        - No packets are attempted to be sent out until :func:`lsquic_engine_send_unsent_packets()`
          is called.

.. function:: void lsquic_engine_process_conns (lsquic_engine_t *engine)

    Process tickable connections.  This function must be called often enough so
    that packets and connections do not expire.  The preferred method of doing
    so is by using :func:`lsquic_engine_earliest_adv_tick()`.

.. function:: int lsquic_engine_has_unsent_packets (lsquic_engine_t *engine)

    Returns true if engine has some unsent packets.  This happens if
    ``ea_packets_out()`` could not send everything out.

.. function:: void lsquic_engine_send_unsent_packets (lsquic_engine_t *engine)

    Send out as many unsent packets as possibe: until we are out of unsent
    packets or until ``ea_packets_out()`` fails.

    If ``ea_packets_out()`` cannot send all packets, this function must be
    called to signify that sending of packets is possible again.

Stream Callback Interface
-------------------------

The stream callback interface structure lists the callbacks used by
the engine to communicate with the user code:

.. type:: struct lsquic_stream_if

    .. member:: lsquic_conn_ctx_t *(*on_new_conn)(void *stream_if_ctx,
                                                        lsquic_conn_t *);

        Called when a new connection has been created.  In server mode,
        this means that the handshake has been successful.  In client mode,
        on the other hand, this callback is called as soon as connection
        object is created inside the engine, but before the handshake is
        done.

        The return value is the connection context associated with this
        connection.  Use :func:`lsquic_conn_get_ctx()` to get back this
        context.  It is OK for this function to return NULL.

        This callback is mandatory.

    .. member:: void (*on_conn_closed)(lsquic_conn_t *)

        Connection is closed.

        This callback is mandatory.

    .. member:: lsquic_stream_ctx_t * (*on_new_stream)(void *stream_if_ctx, lsquic_stream_t *)

        If you need to initiate a connection, call lsquic_conn_make_stream().
        This will cause `on_new_stream` callback to be called when appropriate
        (this operation is delayed when maximum number of outgoing streams is
        reached).

        If connection is going away, this callback may be called with the
        second parameter set to NULL.

        The return value is the stream context associated with the stream.
        A pointer to it is passed to `on_read()`, `on_write()`, and `on_close()`
        callbacks.  It is OK for this function to return NULL.

        This callback is mandatory.

    .. member:: void (*on_read)     (lsquic_stream_t *s, lsquic_stream_ctx_t *h)

        Stream is readable: either there are bytes to be read or an error
        is ready to be collected.

        This callback is mandatory.

    .. member:: void (*on_write)    (lsquic_stream_t *s, lsquic_stream_ctx_t *h)

        Stream is writeable.

        This callback is mandatory.

    .. member:: void (*on_close)    (lsquic_stream_t *s, lsquic_stream_ctx_t *h)

        After this callback returns, the stream is no longer accessible.  This is
        a good time to clean up the stream context.

        This callback is mandatory.

    .. member:: void (*on_hsk_done)(lsquic_conn_t *c, enum lsquic_hsk_status s)

        When handshake is completed, this callback is called.

        This callback is optional.

    .. member:: void (*on_goaway_received)(lsquic_conn_t *)

        This is called when our side received GOAWAY frame.  After this,
        new streams should not be created.

        This callback is optional.

    .. member:: void (*on_new_token)(lsquic_conn_t *c, const unsigned char *token, size_t token_size)

        When client receives a token in NEW_TOKEN frame, this callback is called.

        This callback is optional.

    .. member:: void (*on_zero_rtt_info)(lsquic_conn_t *c, const unsigned char *, size_t)

        This callback lets client record information needed to
        perform a zero-RTT handshake next time around.

        This callback is optional.

Creating Connections
--------------------

In server mode, the connections are created by the library based on incoming
packets.  After handshake is completed, the library calls :func:`on_new_conn()`
callback.

In client mode, a new connection is created by

.. function:: lsquic_conn_t * lsquic_engine_connect (lsquic_engine_t *engine, enum lsquic_version version, const struct sockaddr *local_sa, const struct sockaddr *peer_sa, void *peer_ctx, lsquic_conn_ctx_t *conn_ctx, const char *sni, unsigned short max_udp_payload_size, const unsigned char *zero_rtt, size_t zero_rtt_len, const unsigned char *token, size_t token_sz)

    :param engine: Engine to use.

    :param version:

        To let the engine specify QUIC version, use N_LSQVER.  If zero-rtt info is
        supplied, version is picked from there instead.

    :param local_sa:

        Local address.

    :param peer_sa:

        Address of the server.

    :param peer_ctx:

        Context associated with the connection.  This is what gets passed to TODO.

    :param conn_ctx:

        Connection context can be set early using this parameter.  Useful if
        you need the connection context to be available in `on_conn_new()`.
        Note that that callback's return value replaces the connection
        context set here.

    :param sni:

        The SNI is required for Google QUIC connections; it is optional for
        IETF QUIC and may be set to NULL.

    :param max_udp_payload_size:

        Maximum packet size.  If set to zero, it is inferred based on `peer_sa`
        and `version`.

    :param zero_rtt:

        Pointer to previously saved zero-RTT data needed for TLS resumption.
        May be NULL.

    :param zero_rtt_len:

        Size of zero-RTT data.

    :param token:

        Pointer to previously received token to include in the Initial
        packet.  Tokens are used by IETF QUIC to pre-validate client
        connections, potentially avoiding a retry.

        See ``on_new_token`` callback in :type:`lsquic_stream_if`:

        May be NULL.

    :param token_sz:

        Size of data pointed to by ``token``.

Closing Connections
-------------------

.. function:: void lsquic_conn_going_away (lsquic_conn_t *conn)

    Mark connection as going away: send GOAWAY frame and do not accept
    any more incoming streams, nor generate streams of our own.

    Only applicable to HTTP/3 and GQUIC connections.  Otherwise a no-op.

.. function:: void lsquic_conn_close (lsquic_conn_t *conn)

    This closes the connection.  ``on_conn_closed()`` and ``on_close()`` callbacks will be called.

Creating Streams
----------------

Similar to connections, streams are created by the library in server mode; they
correspond to requests.  In client mode, a new stream is created by

.. function:: void lsquic_conn_make_stream (lsquic_conn_t *)

    Create a new request stream.  This causes :member:`on_new_stream()` callback
    to be called.  If creating more requests is not permitted at the moment
    (due to number of concurrent streams limit), stream creation is registered
    as "pending" and the stream is created later when number of streams dips
    under the limit again.  Any number of pending streams can be created.
    Use :func:`lsquic_conn_n_pending_streams()` and
    :func:`lsquic_conn_cancel_pending_streams()` to manage pending streams.

    If connection is going away, :func:`on_new_stream()` is called with the
    stream parameter set to NULL.

Stream Events
-------------

To register or unregister an interest in a read or write event, use the
following functions:

.. function:: int lsquic_stream_wantread (lsquic_stream_t *stream, int want)

    :param stream: Stream to read from.
    :param want: Boolean value indicating whether the caller wants to read
                 from stream.
    :return: Previous value of ``want`` or ``-1`` if the stream has already
             been closed for reading.

    A stream becomes readable if there is was an error: for example, the
    peer may have reset the stream.  In this case, reading from the stream
    will return an error.

.. function:: int lsquic_stream_wantwrite (lsquic_stream_t *stream, int want)

    :param stream: Stream to write to.
    :param want: Boolean value indicating whether the caller wants to write
                 to stream.
    :return: Previous value of ``want`` or ``-1`` if the stream has already
             been closed for writing.

Reading From Streams
--------------------

.. function:: ssize_t lsquic_stream_read (lsquic_stream_t *stream, unsigned char *buf, size_t sz)

    :param stream: Stream to read from.
    :param buf: Buffer to copy data to.
    :param sz: Size of the buffer.
    :return: Number of bytes read, zero if EOS has been reached, or -1 on error.

    Read up to ``sz`` bytes from ``stream`` into buffer ``buf``.

    ``-1`` is returned on error, in which case ``errno`` is set:

    - ``EBADF``: The stream is closed.
    - ``ECONNRESET``: The stream has been reset.
    - ``EWOULDBLOCK``: There is no data to be read.

.. function:: ssize_t lsquic_stream_readv (lsquic_stream_t *stream, const struct iovec *vec, int iovcnt)

    :param stream: Stream to read from.
    :param vec: Array of ``iovec`` structures.
    :param iovcnt: Number of elements in ``vec``.
    :return: Number of bytes read, zero if EOS has been reached, or -1 on error.

    Similar to :func:`lsquic_stream_read()`, but reads data into a vector.

.. function:: ssize_t lsquic_stream_readf (lsquic_stream_t *stream, size_t (*readf)(void *ctx, const unsigned char *buf, size_t len, int fin), void *ctx)

    :param stream: Stream to read from.

    :param readf:

        The callback takes four parameters:

        - Pointer to user-supplied context;
        - Pointer to the data;
        - Data size (can be zero); and
        - Indicator whether the FIN follows the data.

        The callback returns number of bytes processed.  If this number is zero
        or is smaller than ``len``, reading from stream stops.

    :param ctx: Context pointer passed to ``readf``.

    This function allows user-supplied callback to read the stream contents.
    It is meant to be used for zero-copy stream processing.

    Return value and errors are same as in :func:`lsquic_stream_read()`.

Writing To Streams
------------------

.. function:: ssize_t lsquic_stream_write (lsquic_stream_t *stream, const void *buf, size_t len)

    :param stream: Stream to write to.
    :param buf: Buffer to copy data from.
    :param len: Number of bytes to copy.
    :return: Number of bytes written -- which may be smaller than ``len`` -- or a negative
             value when an error occurs.

    Write ``len`` bytes to the stream.  Returns number of bytes written, which
    may be smaller that ``len``.

    A negative return value indicates a serious error (the library is likely
    to have aborted the connection because of it).

.. function:: ssize_t lsquic_stream_writev (lsquic_stream_t *s, const struct iovec *vec, int count)

    Like :func:`lsquic_stream_write()`, but read data from a vector.

.. type:: struct lsquic_reader

    Used as argument to :func:`lsquic_stream_writef()`.

    .. member:: size_t (*lsqr_read) (void *lsqr_ctx, void *buf, size_t count)

        :param lsqr_ctx: Pointer to user-specified context.
        :param buf: Memory location to write to.
        :param count: Size of available memory pointed to by ``buf``.
        :return:

            Number of bytes written.  This is not a ``ssize_t`` because
            the read function is not supposed to return an error.  If an error
            occurs in the read function (for example, when reading from a file
            fails), it is supposed to deal with the error itself.

    .. member:: size_t (*lsqr_size) (void *lsqr_ctx)

        Return number of bytes remaining in the reader.

    .. member:: void    *lsqr_ctx

        Context pointer passed both to ``lsqr_read()`` and to ``lsqr_size()``.

.. function:: ssize_t lsquic_stream_writef (lsquic_stream_t *stream, struct lsquic_reader *reader)

    :param stream: Stream to write to.
    :param reader: Reader to read from.
    :return: Number of bytes written or -1 on error.

    Write to stream using :type:`lsquic_reader`.  This is the most generic of
    the write functions -- :func:`lsquic_stream_write()` and
    :func:`lsquic_stream_writev()` utilize the same mechanism.

.. function:: int lsquic_stream_flush (lsquic_stream_t *stream)

    :param stream: Stream to flush.
    :return: 0 on success and -1 on failure.

    Flush any buffered data.  This triggers packetizing even a single byte
    into a separate frame.  Flushing a closed stream is an error.

Closing Streams
---------------

Streams can be closed for reading, writing, or both.
``on_close()`` callback is called at some point after a stream is closed
for both reading and writing,

.. function:: int lsquic_stream_shutdown (lsquic_stream_t *stream, int how)

    :param stream: Stream to shut down.
    :param how:

        This parameter specifies what do to.  Allowed values are:

        - 0: Stop reading.
        - 1: Stop writing.
        - 2: Stop both reading and writing.

    :return: 0 on success or -1 on failure.

.. function:: int lsquic_stream_close (lsquic_stream_t *stream)

    :param stream: Stream to close.
    :return: 0 on success or -1 on failure.

Sending HTTP Headers
--------------------

    .. member:: uint8_t           dec_overhead

        num of extra bytes written to decoded buffer

.. type:: lsquic_http_headers_t

    .. member::     int   count

        Number of headers in ``headers``.

    .. member::     struct lsxpack_header   *headers

        Pointer to an array of HTTP headers.

    HTTP header list structure.  Contains a list of HTTP headers.

.. function:: int lsquic_stream_send_headers (lsquic_stream_t *stream, const lsquic_http_headers_t *headers, int eos)

    :param stream:

        Stream to send headers on.

    :param headers:

        Headers to send.

    :param eos:

        Boolean value to indicate whether these headers constitute the whole
        HTTP message.

    :return:

        0 on success or -1 on error.

Receiving HTTP Headers
----------------------

If ``ea_hsi_if`` is not set in :type:`lsquic_engine_api`, the library will translate
HPACK- and QPACK-encoded headers into HTTP/1.x-like headers and prepend them to the
stream.  To the stream-reading function, it will look as if a standard HTTP/1.x
message.

Alternatively, you can specify header-processing set of functions and manage header
fields yourself.  In that case, the header set must be "read" from the stream via
:func:`lsquic_stream_get_hset()`.

.. type:: struct lsquic_hset_if

    .. member::  void * (*hsi_create_header_set)(void *hsi_ctx, lsquic_stream_t *stream, int is_push_promise)

        :param hsi_ctx: User context.  This is the pointer specifed in ``ea_hsi_ctx``.
        :param stream: Stream with which the header set is associated.  May be set
                       to NULL in server mode.
        :param is_push_promise: Boolean value indicating whether this header set is
                                for a push promise.
        :return: Pointer to user-defined header set object.

        Create a new header set.  This object is (and must be) fetched from a
        stream by calling :func:`lsquic_stream_get_hset()` before the stream can
        be read.

    .. member:: struct lsxpack_header * (*hsi_prepare_decode)(void *hdr_set, struct lsxpack_header *hdr, size_t space)

        Return a header set prepared for decoding.  If ``hdr`` is NULL, this
        means return a new structure with at least ``space`` bytes available
        in the decoder buffer.  On success, a newly prepared header is
        returned.

        If ``hdr`` is not NULL, it means there was not enough decoder buffer
        and it must be increased to at least ``space`` bytes.  ``buf``, ``val_len``,
        and ``name_offset`` member of the ``hdr`` structure may change.  On
        success, the return value is the same as ``hdr``.

        If NULL is returned, the space cannot be allocated.

    .. member:: int (*hsi_process_header)(void *hdr_set, struct lsxpack_header *hdr)

        Process new header.

        :param hdr_set:

            Header set to add the new header field to.  This is the object
            returned by ``hsi_create_header_set()``.

        :param hdr:

            The header returned by @ref ``hsi_prepare_decode()``.

        :return:

            Return 0 on success, a positive value if a header error occured,
            or a negative value on any other error.  A positive return value
            will result in cancellation of associated stream. A negative return
            value will result in connection being aborted.

    .. member:: void                (*hsi_discard_header_set)(void *hdr_set)

        :param hdr_set: Header set to discard.

        Discard header set.  This is called for unclaimed header sets and
        header sets that had an error.

    .. member:: enum lsquic_hsi_flag hsi_flags

        These flags specify properties of decoded headers passed to
        ``hsi_process_header()``.  This is only applicable to QPACK headers;
        HPACK library header properties are based on compilation, not
        run-time, options.

.. function:: void * lsquic_stream_get_hset (lsquic_stream_t *stream)

    :param stream: Stream to fetch header set from.

    :return: Header set associated with the stream.

    Get header set associated with the stream.  The header set is created by
    ``hsi_create_header_set()`` callback.  After this call, the ownership of
    the header set is transferred to the caller.

    This call must precede calls to :func:`lsquic_stream_read()`,
    :func:`lsquic_stream_readv()`, and :func:`lsquic_stream_readf()`.

    If the optional header set interface is not specified,
    this function returns NULL.

Push Promises
-------------

.. function:: int lsquic_conn_push_stream (lsquic_conn_t *conn, void *hdr_set, lsquic_stream_t *stream, const lsquic_http_headers_t *headers)

    :return:

        - 0: Stream pushed successfully.
        - 1: Stream push failed because it is disabled or because we hit
             stream limit or connection is going away.
        - -1: Stream push failed because of an internal error.

    A server may push a stream.  This call creates a new stream in reference
    to stream ``stream``.  It will behave as if the client made a request: it will
    trigger ``on_new_stream()`` event and it can be used as a regular client-initiated stream.

    ``hdr_set`` must be set.  It is passed as-is to :func:`lsquic_stream_get_hset()`.

.. function:: int lsquic_conn_is_push_enabled (lsquic_conn_t *conn)

    :return: Boolean value indicating whether push promises are enabled.

    Only makes sense in server mode: the client cannot push a stream and this
    function always returns false in client mode.

.. function: int lsquic_stream_is_pushed (const lsquic_stream_t *stream)

    :return: Boolean value indicating whether this is a pushed stream.

.. function:: int lsquic_stream_refuse_push (lsquic_stream_t *stream)

    Refuse pushed stream.  Call it from ``on_new_stream()``.  No need to
    call :func:`lsquic_stream_close()` after this.  ``on_close()`` will be called.

.. function:: int lsquic_stream_push_info (const lsquic_stream_t *stream, lsquic_stream_id_t *ref_stream_id, void **hdr_set)

    Get information associated with pushed stream

    :param ref_stream_id: Stream ID in response to which push promise was sent.
    :param hdr_set: Header set. This object was passed to or generated by :func:`lsquic_conn_push_stream()`.

    :return: 0 on success and -1 if this is not a pushed stream.

Stream Priorities
-----------------

.. function:: unsigned lsquic_stream_priority (const lsquic_stream_t *stream)

    Return current priority of the stream.

.. function:: int lsquic_stream_set_priority (lsquic_stream_t *stream, unsigned priority)

    Set stream priority.  Valid priority values are 1 through 256, inclusive.

    :return: 0 on success of -1 on failure (this happens if priority value is invalid).

.. function:: unsigned lsquic_engine_count_attq (lsquic_engine_t *engine, int from_now)

    Return number of connections whose advisory tick time is before current
    time plus ``from_now`` microseconds from now.  ``from_now`` can be negative.

    .. member:: int (*shi_insert)(void *shi_ctx, void *key, unsigned key_sz, void *data, unsigned data_sz, time_t expiry)

        :param shi_ctx:

            Shared memory context pointer

        :param key:

            Key data.

        :param data_sz:

            Data size.

        :param expiry: When this item expires.  If you want your item to never expire, set this to zero.

        :return: 0 on success, -1 on failure.

        If inserted successfully, ``free()`` will be called on ``data`` and ``key``
        pointer when the element is deleted, whether due to expiration
        or explicit deletion.

    .. member:: int (*shi_delete)(void *shi_ctx, const void *key, unsigned key_sz)

        Delete item from shared hash

        :return: 0 on success, -1 on failure.

        :return:

            - ``1``: found.
            - ``0``: not found.
            - ``-1``:  error (perhaps not enough room in ``data`` if copy was attempted).

         The implementation may choose to copy the object into buffer pointed
         to by ``data``, so you should have it ready.

.. type:: struct lsquic_packout_mem_if

    The packet out memory interface is used by LSQUIC to get buffers to
    which outgoing packets will be written before they are passed to
    :member:`lsquic_engine_api.ea_packets_out` callback.

    .. member:: LLTS_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSSMS

        Like above, plus date, e.g: 2017-03-21 13:43:46.671

    .. member:: LLTS_CHROMELIKE

        This is Chrome-like timestamp used by proto-quic.  The timestamp
        includes month, date, hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds.

        Example: 1223/104613.946956 (instead of 12/23 10:46:13.946956).

        This is to facilitate reading two logs side-by-side.

    .. member:: LLTS_HHMMSSUS

        The timestamp consists of 24 hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds.  Example: 13:43:46.671123

    .. member:: LLTS_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSSUS

    .. member:: LSCONN_ST_CLOSED
    .. member:: LSCONN_ST_PEER_GOING_AWAY

.. type:: enum lsquic_hsi_flag

    These flags are ORed together to specify properties of
    :type:`lsxpack_header` passed to :member:`lsquic_hset_if.hsi_process_header`.

    .. member:: LSQUIC_HSI_HTTP1X

        Turn HTTP/1.x mode on or off.  In this mode, decoded name and value
        pair are separated by ``": "`` and ``"\r\n"`` is appended to the end
        of the string.  By default, this mode is off.

    .. member:: LSQUIC_HSI_HASH_NAME

        Include name hash into lsxpack_header.

    .. member:: LSQUIC_HSI_HASH_NAMEVAL
