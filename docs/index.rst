LSQUIC Documentation
====================

This is the documentation for LSQUIC_ |release|, last updated |today|.

LiteSpeed QUIC (LSQUIC) Library is an open-source implementation of QUIC
and HTTP/3 functionality for servers and clients.  LSQUIC is:

- fast;

- flexible; and

- production-ready.

Most of the code in this distribution has been  used in our own products
-- `LiteSpeed Web Server`_, `LiteSpeed Web ADC`_, and OpenLiteSpeed_ --
since 2017.

Currently supported QUIC versions are Q043, Q046, Q050, ID-27, and ID-28.
Support for newer versions will be added soon after they are released.

LSQUIC is licensed under the `MIT License`_; see LICENSE in the source
